# Hi there!!

Welcome to **Paroleco** Language Exchange Club - PLEC 🌍

This is an International Language Exchange Club, organized in a group with a set of _topics_, allowing people from all over the world to connect and interact with each other to improve whichever languages they are learning. Here you will find both people studying as well as natives who will help you with any questions you may have.

# Welcome!

The exchange is based on volunteers like yourself. You join the club and talk into the language topics you want to learn, and in your native language topic so you can teach and give back to the community.

In the main Lounge topic you can meet everyone from the club. These are the three (3) minimum topics you should pay attention, but you can join others if you are interested in learning more than one language.

We have topics for every language. You can join whichever one you want, whenever you want, just go for it!

Welcome and have a great time!
